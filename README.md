PyCitySchools Analysis
Project Overview
The PyCitySchools Analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance of various schools within a fictional district using Python and the Pandas library. This project utilizes data analysis techniques to evaluate and visualize the relationships between school spending, school size, school type, and academic performance. By analyzing this data, we aim to identify trends and correlations that can help in understanding the factors contributing to school success.

Objectives
Data Extraction and Cleaning:

Import and inspect data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and completeness.
Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
Data Analysis:

Perform descriptive statistics to summarize key metrics.
Analyze school performance based on various factors such as budget, size, and type.
Visualization:

Create visualizations to illustrate the findings and trends.
Use these visualizations to communicate insights effectively.
Key Insights
School Spending vs. Performance:

Analyze the impact of per-student spending on academic performance.
Determine whether higher spending translates to better test scores and passing rates.
School Size vs. Performance:

Evaluate the performance differences between small, medium, and large schools.
Identify any trends that suggest optimal school sizes for better academic outcomes.
School Type vs. Performance:

Compare the performance metrics between charter schools and district schools.
Highlight the differences in outcomes and potential reasons behind them.
